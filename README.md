## üìå Project Objective
> Query and analyze NSG (Network Security Group) flow logs in Azure using KQL to detect potentially malicious traffic targeting a virtual machine. This project focuses on interpreting network-level telemetry data for security monitoring.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- **Platform:** Azure
- **OS:** N/A
- **Tools:** Azure Network Watcher, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, PowerShell
- **Languages/Scripts:** KQL

---

## üß† Skills Gained / Focus Areas
- Queried NSG flow logs using the AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL table
- Identified flows classified as "MaliciousFlow"
- Filtered logs by VM IP and summarized by source IP
- Built a query to count and rank suspicious traffic

---

## üß™ Environment Setup
> NSG flow logs were enabled and sent to a Log Analytics workspace. The AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL table was queried to analyze network events for a specific virtual machine.

## üõ†Ô∏è Walkthrough
1. [Step 1: Enable NSG Logs](#step-1-enable-nsg-logs)
2. [Step 2: Run Malicious Flow Query](#step-2-run-malicious-flow-query)
3. [Step 3: Interpret Results](#step-3-interpret-results)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Enable NSG Logs
> - Enabled NSG flow logs for relevant NSGs via Azure Network Watcher  
> - Configured log analytics workspace as the destination  
> - Confirmed data was appearing in AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL table

![Step 1](assets/images/step1.jpg)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Run Malicious Flow Query
> Executed the following KQL query to identify suspicious traffic:

```kql
let my_vm_ip_address = "10.0.0.5";
AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL
| where FlowType_s == "MaliciousFlow" and TimeGenerated > ago(5h) and DestIP_s in (my_vm_ip_address)
| summarize flow_count = count() by SrcIP_s, DestIP_s, FlowType_s
| order by flow_count
```

> **Purpose:**
> - Focus on traffic marked as "MaliciousFlow"
> - Narrow scope to a specific destination IP (VM)
> - Count and rank flows by source IP

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Interpret Results
> - Identified top offending source IPs targeting the VM  
> - Used data for further investigation or alerting  
> - Practiced adjusting time window and flow type filters

## üìù Outcomes and Lessons Learned
- **Technical Insight:** NSG flow logs provide visibility into network behavior and can identify malicious actors.
- **Configuration Skills:** Enabled flow log diagnostics and queried using Azure Monitor.
- **Troubleshooting:** Refined filters to ensure data accuracy for the target IP and timeframe.
- **Takeaway:** Monitoring flow logs is essential for detecting lateral movement, port scanning, or brute-force attempts.
